    Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
    In other words, this assumes that however many times
    a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
    many of that letter in it. 
    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.
    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.
